Since this version, an automatic slideshow is added to the multibox. The slideshow is available in mootools framework 1.11 and 1.2 too.


= Big step to version 1.2.0 =

You have the choice: Use the stable version 1.0.8 with the mootools version 1.11, or go up to version 1.2.0 that fully integrates the new version of mootools framework. Tested on wp 2.5.1 up to 2.6.1 on FF and IE on PC.


= In version 1.0.6 = You can set the title and descritpion in the "advanced" tab in the image settings.Also I have integrated the twinhelix PNG Bugfix for Internet Explorer in this beautiful plugin :-)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I manually open links in the multibox? =

Yes. When you make a link in the editor of wordpress, use the 'class="mb"' tag. Example:
Open google in a window: <a class=”mb” rel=”width:600,height:500? href=”http://www.google.de”>Link zu Google (HTML in Multibox)</a>
When you make use of the rel="" tag, you can set an width and height of the multibox frame.


= Can I set a title and description that is displaying only in the multibox? =
Yes, you can. Insert the image in your post an klick on the settings button on the image and go to the "advanced" tab. Fill out the field title and description. That`s it :)

== Important ==

= Problems with JavaScript =

If you have problems with javascript errors, please make sure, you have not installed other lightbox plugins like thickbox, lightbox2 and so on.

When you install the multibox plugin, there will be used the mootools framework in version 1.11. If you have problems, you can switch the mootools version in the settings page to v 1.2.
