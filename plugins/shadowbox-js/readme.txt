Shadowbox is an online media vieiwing application similar to Lightbox and Thickbox but with more functionality. Supports all types of media.

== Description ==

Shadowbox is an online media viewing application that supports all of the web's most popular media publishing formats. Shadowbox is written entirely in JavaScript and CSS and is highly customizable. Using Shadowbox, website authors can display a wide assortment of media in all major browsers without navigating users away from the linking page. 

This plugin uses [Shadowbox](http://www.shadowbox-js.com/) written by [Michael J. I. Jackson](http://mjijackson.com). 

Javascript libraries supported are: None, YUI, Prototype, jQuery, Ext, Dojo and MooTools. Ext is included with the plugin, Prototype and jQuery are used from the Javascript libraries included with Wordpress, YUI is loaded from Yahoo APIs, Dojo and Mootools are loaded from Google APIs. 

This plugin can also be used as a drop in lightbox replacement, without requiring you to edit posts already using lightbox. 

By default this plugin will use Shadowbox for all image links, movie links, audio links and YouTube/Google Video links including those generated by the [gallery] shortcode.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What image file types will this plugin automatically add Shadowbox to? =

bmp, gif, png, jpg, and jpeg

= What movie file types will this plugin automatically add Shadowbox to? =

swf, flv, f4v, dv, mov, moov, movie, mp4, asf, wm, wmv, avi, mpg and mpeg

= What audio file types will this plugin automatically add Shadowbox to? =

mp3 and aac

= When I click on my YouTube links I see the full YouTube web site and not just my video. What is wrong? =

You have probably used the wrong form of the YouTube URL. If you used something like `http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=3D3kFn_3xRY` that will disaply the YouTube website and not just the video. To just get the video use a link that looks like `http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;v&#47;3D3kFn_3xRY`.

= How can I use a custom Shadowbox skin without having to worry about it being deleted during the upgrade process? = 

In version 3.0.0.0 there are now 2 parts to the skin, the markup file and the CSS. Place your custom skin in a location where it will not get removed. For example in your current themes directory. Below is an example:

`wp-content/themes/yourthemename/shadowbox-custom-skin` 

Once you have placed the skin in this directory you will need to add a few lines to your themes functions.php file. Below is some sample code:

`
function shadowbox_custom_markup($markup) {
	$markup = 'http://example.org/wp-content/themes/yourthemename/shadowbox-custom-skin/markup.js';
	return $markup;
}
add_filter('shadowbox-markup', 'shadowbox_custom_markup');

function shadowbox_custom_css($css) {
	$css = 'http://example.org/wp-content/themes/yourthemename/shadowbox-custom-skin/shadowbox.css';
	return $css;
}
add_filter('shadowbox-css', 'shadowbox_custom_css');
`

You do not necessarily have to do both.  It is possible to only load a custom markup or only a custom css.

= Can I selectively load Shadowbox on pages that need it? =

Yes.  However this functionality requires WordPress 2.8.  If you are running WordPress 2.8 and you would like to enable this functionality visit `Settings -> Shadowbox JS` and set `Enable Smart Loading` to `true`.

= Why isn't this plugin working? =

Check to make sure that you have `<?php wp_head(); ?>` in your themes header.php and `<?php wp_footer(); ?>` in your themes fotoer.php. See the default WordPress theme for examples. Also see the FAQ below.

= This plugin has stopped working since I installed another plugin or another plugin has stopped working since I installed this plugin. What can I do? =

Try changing the Javascript Library used by this plugin to something other than 'None' on the Shadowbox JS settings page in the WordPress admin.

== Screenshots ==

1. An Image
2. A Website
3. A YouTube Video

== Upgrade ==

1. Use the plugin updater in WordPress or...
1. Deactivate the Shadowbox JS plugin
1. Delete the previous `shadowbox-js` folder from the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Upload the new `shadowbox-js` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the Shadowbox JS plugin
1. Optional: Visit the settings page in the WordPress admin at `Settings -> Shadowbox JS`

== Usage ==

1. By default this plugin will add the activator attribute to all image links, movie links, audio links and YouTube/Google Video links that do not already have the activator attribute. Meaning basically, by default all images in the posts on your site will automatically be displayed using Shadowbox. If you want more fine grain control over the links continue with the next steps.
1. Create a link in your post in the following format (This link can be to pretty much anything including websites, video files, YouTube, Google Video and inline content):

`&lt;a href="http://domain.tld/directory/to/image.jpg" rel="shadowbox[album]"&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt;`

1. Be sure to include `rel="shadowbox"` as this activates the plugin.
1. If `rel="shadowbox[album]"` is included the portion listed here as `[album]` will group multiple pictures into an album called album. Do not use `[gallery]` to define an album as WordPress has a shortcode that will interfere. 
1. If you are using this as a lightbox replacement you do not need to change `rel="lightbox"` to `rel="shadowbox"`. Shadowbox.js supports `rel="lightbox"` natively.
1. If you want to make a gallery/album and only want one link to display you can use `class="hidden"` to hide the additional links.
1. See [http://shadowbox-js.com/doc/usage.html#markup](http://shadowbox-js.com/doc/usage.html#markup) for detailed markup instructions.
1. If you are using using Shadowbox globally for all images but have an image you do not wish to use Shadowbox on use `rel="nobox"` in your image link.
